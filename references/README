This directory structure contains reference system outputs and evaluation
results.

It is divided based on the system evaluation setting:

* system-mentions/ contains outputs where the system did not use any manual
  mention annotations
* gold-all-mentions/ contains outputs where the system was provided with manual
  named entity annotation (CoNLL 2003 Shared Task ground truth, with or without
  exploiting true type), with the task of disambiguating against a KB and the
  "NIL" decision.
* gold-linked-mentions/ contains outputs where the system was provided with
  only those mentions that could be assigned a KB entity, without the issue of
  NIL decision. (This is the task originally described in Hoffart et al
  (EMNLP 2011), and given that their ground truth annotation is constrained by
  the ability to retrieve entities by name within their KB, it is arguably the
  most meaningful evaluation over that dataset as published.)

System outputs/evaluations are also specified by the following features:
* the particular system (e.g. publication and parameters)
* the dataset (presently AIDA-YAGO's 2011 annotation over CoNLL 2003 ST's
  testb portion)
* mapping of output to a shared KB ID space (cf. the ``prepare`` command)
* optionally, a filter over the output (cf. the ``filter`` command)
